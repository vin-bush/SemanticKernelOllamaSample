To run this sample

1. Install ollama
Download and install from here https://ollama.com/download

2. Test ollama install and download the model used in the sample
Open a commandline
Enter 'ollama run llama3.1'
This will automatically download the model (about 4GB)

If you're on a lower power machine (ie Momentus provided laptop) enter 'ollama run llama3.2:1b'
This is a new smaller model designed to run anywhere
If you do this, also update appsettings.Development.json

3. Enable GPU utilization (optional)
My Momentus laptop has an NVIDIA RTX A500, it performs about the same on CPU and GPU, but might be faster on your machine.
My PC has an NVIDIA RTX 3070 and performs seamlessly on the GPU

GPU utilization might be automatic, they were on my PC but not laptop, if not the steps are:
Locate the ollama executable that runs the model, check Task Manager while interacting with the ollama commandline to find it
for me it was C:\Users\Vin.Bush\AppData\Local\Programs\Ollama\lib\ollama\runners\cuda_v12\ollama_llama_server.exe,

Open the NVIDIA control panel
Click manage gpu utlization
Select use for graphics and compute needs
Click manage 3D settings
Under select a program click add
Click browse and enter the path of the ollama executable we found above
Select the 'High-performance NVIDIA processor' option for preferred graphics processor

4. Run the project using visual studio or dotnet commandline
